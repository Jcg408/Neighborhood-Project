Udacity Project 5 - Neighborhood Map
Jessica Gladstone - updated 4/23/16
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was to incorporate the Google Maps Api with Knockout JS to create a 
neighborhood map of interesting locations.  Functionality should include clickable list and markers, 
filtering search capability of list and markers, and the use of a third party API (Wikipedia). Error handling must be 
used in case of failure to load.

I believe I was able to capture all requirements to finish the project. It is not as dazzling as some of the projects
I researched but it has the basics of what is necessary. I have learned quite a bit from this project. Mainly,  that asking 
and accepting help isn't a weakness. I could not have finished this without the help of those mentioned below.

Virginia Shenandoah Valley Attractions-
1. List of Shenandoah Valley popular attractions.
2. Google map with markers showing location of the attractions.
3. Infowindows open with information about the specified location and markers bounce when clicked
4. Integration of Wikipedia API.  Input of location name retrieves an article list linked to the Wikipedia site.
5. List of locations animate appropriate marker when clicked
6. List search/filter is functional and filters with markers
7. Marker toggleBounce is set to stop after a short period of time - 1250ms.
8. Error handling is set for Google API and Wikipedia API.
9. Application is responsive to different device sizes.

## CITATIONS - Thank you immensely to Udacity Coach - Heidi Kasemir- she was inspirational and motivational. She is an excellent guide and coach. I really would
not have finished this without her help. Karol David helped me with trying to work out the YELP API( which was eventually abandoned due to corrupt YELP credentials)
which led me to research OAuth and how it really works. I also have some outside programming mentors, Jimmy Sambuo & Rich Paulson,  who gave me insight into how
professionals look at a problem and ways of finding solutions. It's nice to know that even the tops in their fields get stuck and have to use Google, StackOverflow, Github, 
W3Schools - etc. and sometimes experience the same frustrations that I did on this project.  I also used projects on Github from other Udacity students to give me inspiration
and ideas. 

** Great online resources include: W3Schools, MDN Javascript, Knockout Documentation,Complete Guide to Flex-Box/CSS-Tricks , StackOverflow, Google Developer, 
    Bytespider API Reference, Mark Trapp's OAuth for Dummies, JQuery.com.
