Udacity Project 5 - Neighborhood Map

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------After working on this project for 2.5 months and with a lot of help from various people. I was able to get it functioning. However, now I have to change my 3rd party API because it did not meet the new rubric( I could swear that originally when I started this project, I was told that the only stipulation was no Google API) and it needs to be connected to the list, marker or filter function as well as have location information attached. Anyway - I have looked at so many APIS and they are very difficult to use. Most of them use OAuth which is driving me crazy. I settle on Yelp and have found some resources with code which does not seem to work for me. I am struggling and I have passed the 2nd deadline and I Officially am OVER THIS PROJECT!!
