Udacity Project 5 - Neighborhood Map
Jessica Gladstone - updated 4/7/16
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was to incorporate the Google Maps Api with Knockout JS to create a 
neighborhood map of interesting locations.  Functionality should include clickable list and markers, 
filtering search capability of list and markers, and the use of a third party API (Wine.com). Error handling must be 
used in case of failure to load.

I believe I was able to capture all requirements to finish the project. It is not as dazzling as some of the projects
I researched but it has the basics of what is necessary. I have learned quite a bit from this project. Mainly,  that asking 
and accepting help isn't a weakness. I could not have finished this without the help of those mentioned below.

Virginia Shenandoah Valley Wine Country -
1. List of wineries
2. Google map with markers showing location of the wineries
3. Infowindows open and markers bounce when clicked
4. Integration of Wine.com API. Website catalog opens in new window when marker clicked.
5. List of locations animate appropriate marker when clicked
6. List search/filter is functional and filters with markers
7. Marker toggleBounce is set to stop after a short period of time - 1250ms.
8. Error handling is set for Google API and Wine API.

Citations - Thank you immensely to Udacity Coach - Heidi Kasemir- she was inspirational and motivational. She is an excellent guide and coach. I really would
not have finished this without her help. Forum mentors Andrew and Karol were also very helpful. I also have some outside programming masters who gave 
me insight into how professionals look at a problem and ways of finding solutions. It's nice to know that even the tops in their fields get stuck and have to use 
Google, StackOverflow, Github, W3Schools - etc. and sometimes experience the same frustrations that I did on this project.  I also used projects on Github from
other Udacity students to give me inspiration and ideas.
